1. Designed and implemented  a sensor simulation + calibration system to simulate and calibrate an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for UAV applications.

### To run:
1.First Run the CalibParams.m file
2.Run the Simulink model (Imu_sensor_module).
3.Finally run ImuCalibrationGui.m file for,
    ○ Capturing data for bias and scale factor estimation
    ○ Estimating calibration parameters. 
    ○ Visualizing sensor outputs before and after calibration. 
    ○ Saving calibration profiles for later use
